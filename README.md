## About

Huxley 2 is a CORS enabled cross-platform JSON ReST proxy for the GB NRE LDB WCF SOAP XML API (called Darwin). It supports both the Public Version (PV) and the Staff Version (SV). It's built with ASP.NET Core LTS, C# 8.0 and lots of abbreviations!

The primary purpose of Huxley 2 is to allow easy use of the LDB API from browser-based client-side PWAs made with JavaScript or TypeScript. Additionally, it opens up the Windows enterprise API to agile developers on macOS and Linux.
